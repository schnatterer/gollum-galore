üç¨ [Gollum wiki](https://github.com/gollum) with lots of sugar. üç¨

HTTPS/TLS, HTTP2, gzip, HTTP basic, JWT, [etc](https://caddyserver.com/docs).

Inspired by [suttang/gollum](https://github.com/suttang/docker-gollum), enriched with sugar provided by the [caddy server](https://caddyserver.com/features).

If you're interested in git-based wikis, also have a look at [smeagol-galore](https://github.com/schnatterer/smeagol-galore), which is much faster than gollum, has a modern WYSIWYG interface, including [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) and includes [SCM-Manager](https://www.scm-manager.org/) to provide direct access to your Git repos.

# Getting to it

## Super simple setup

`docker run  -p 8080:80 schnatterer/gollum-galore`

* Serves gollum at `http://localhost:8080`,
* The wiki data is stored in an anonymous volume.

## Basic Auth

`docker run -p80:80 -e GOLLUM_PARAMS="--allow-uploads --live-preview" -e CADDY_PARAMS="-conf /gollum/config/Caddyfile" -v ~/gollum:/gollum schnatterer/gollum-galore`

Combined with the following file on your host at `~/gollum/Caddyfile`
```
import /app/Caddyfile
basicauth / test test
```

* Serves gollum at `http://localhost`,
* some of [gollum's command line options](https://github.com/gollum/gollum#configuration) are set
* enables HTTP basic auth, allowing only user `test` password `test`
* The wiki data is stored in `~/gollum/wiki`.  
  Make sure that UID/GID 1000 (used by the container) are allowed to write here. 

You can set the git author using `git config user.name 'John Doe' && git config user.email 'john@doe.org'` in this folder.

## JWT

If you prefer a login form and access tokens with longer expiry timeouts, this can be realized using Caddy's [login](https://github.com/tarent/loginsrv/tree/master/caddy) (aka [http.login](https://caddyserver.com/docs/http.login)) and [jwt](https://github.com/BTBurke/caddy-jwt) (aka [http.jwt](https://caddyserver.com/docs/http.jwt)) plugins, that are included in gollum galore.

```
import /app/Caddyfile

jwt {
    path /
    redirect /login
    allow sub demo
    allow sub bob
}

login {
    success_url /
    htpasswd file=/gollum/config/passwords
    simple bob=secret,alice=secret
}
```
This shows two possibilites: htpasswd (hashed with MD5, SHA1 or Bcrypt) and simple (not recommended, because plain and therefore less secure).
Mount your `.htpasswd` file at `/gollum/config/passwords`. This example bases on a `.htpasswd` file user `demo`. For example: `demo:$2y$10$B/lwbuYGkYDe6wYE4LpuE.DlFFEnM7mK4V7jXDTGJUVEtGZ2P63DK` (user demo, password demo).
Create your own .htpasswd (using Bcrypt): ` htpasswd -n -B -C15 <username>`.

Note: If you're running in **HTTP mode** (no HTTPS/TLS) you will have to set `cookie_secure false` in `login`!
The other option is to use a self-signed certificate, see bellow.  
See https://github.com/BTBurke/caddy-jwt/issues/42 

## HTTPS

The following makes Caddy challenge a certificate at letsencrypt.

`docker run -p80:80 -e 443:443 -e HOST=yourdomain.com -e CADDY_PARAMS=" -agree -email=you@yourdomain.com" -v ~/gollum:/gollum gollum-galore`

This will of course only work if this is bound to yourdomain.com:80 and yourdomain:443.

See also [Automatic HTTPS - Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https).

On Openshift we have some other challenges to take. See bellow.

### Self signed

For local testing you might want to use a self-signed certificate. This can be done as follows:

`docker run -p8443:443 -e GOLLUM_PARAMS="--allow-uploads --live-preview" -e CADDY_PARAMS="-conf /gollum/config/Caddyfile" -e HOST="*:443" " -v ~/gollum:/gollum gollum`

Combined with the following file on your host at `~/gollum/Caddyfile`:

```
import /app/Caddyfile

tls self_signed
```

# Running on Kubernetes (Openshift)

## Simple setup

You can run gollum-gallore easily on any Kubernetes cluster. It even runs on the [free starter plan of openshift v3](https://www.openshift.com/pricing/index.html).

You can find all necessary descriptors in [`openshift-descriptors-http.yaml`](openshift-descriptors-http.yaml). Most of them are standard kubernetes except for the route, which will work only on openshift.
It also shows how to specify gollum params and activates basic auth for user `harry` and the password`sally` via a base64-encoded secret.

If you want to deploy it, all you got to do is
```
oc new-project gollum-galore
kubectl apply -f openshift-descriptors-http.yaml
```

You can query the URL of your route like so: ` oc get route gollum-galore-generated`.

As soon as your pod is ready your gollum wiki will be served at this location.

Note: This is HTTP only! If you're happy with the generated to domain, you can change the route to be `edge`. If you would like to use a custom domain, see bellow.

Sidenote: There also is a [(discontinued) first version of an openshift template](https://github.com/schnatterer/gollum-galore/blob/59cae8ca93d127bed8efbe22d04c6b32860400dd/openshift-template.yaml).

## HTTPS (Custom Domain)

Unfortunately, no luck getting Letsencrypt running on openshift. There justed to be workarounds (see git history of this file) but Openshift seems to have ended their "grace period during the initial launch of Starter" (see [here](https://www.queryxchange.com/q/27_47104454/openshift-online-v3-adding-new-route-gives-forbidden-error/)) plan, where they did not enforce that you cannot specify domain names with the starter plan.

## Credentials

* For Basic Auth see [`openshift-descriptors-http.yaml`](openshift-descriptors-http.yaml)
* For JWT see [`openshift-descriptors-https-self-signed.yaml`](openshift-descriptors-https-self-signed.yaml)

# Architecture decisions

## Why Caddy?
* Almost no configuration necessary
* Works as transparent proxy
* Provides HTTS/Letsencrypt out of the box

Evaluated Alternatives
* Traefik: Easy config, also for Letsencrypt, but didn't work as transparent proxy. Gollums 302 redirects lead to forward to port 4567 in browser, which is not exposed by container (by design!) See [Traefik proof of concept](https://github.com/schnatterer/gollum-galore/tree/traefik)
* NGINX: Worked as transparent proxy but letsencrypt required installing a seperate cron proxy. Lots of effort and larger docker image. See [NGINX proof of concept](https://github.com/schnatterer/gollum-galore/tree/nginx)


## Why two processes in one Container?
* Gollum wiki is not indended to handle features such as HTTPS and auth -> We need a reverse proxy for that.
* It's just easier to ship this as one artifact.
* Gollum is not really scaleable like this anyway.
* You can run it on the free starter plan of openshift v3 :-)

# Development

Build local image and run container. Mount local folder `gollum` into the container. There, create a `Caddyfile` as shown in the examples above.

* `docker build -f Dockerfile -t gollum-galore:latest .`
* `docker run -p80:80  --name gg --rm  -e CADDY_PARAMS="-conf /gollum/config/Caddyfile" -v gollum:/gollum gollum-galore`
